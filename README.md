# screaming-architecture
Inspired by book "Clean Architecture"

In his book Uncle Bob said that each architecture of software should scream about
it's purpose. When you create any application it should be clear after first look 
what this software is created for. 

And another interesting idea that I found in the book that first we should think
about entities - main rules of the application. Then add use cases and only after
that start thinking about everything else: frameworks, DB, gateways and so on.

In this repo I try to apply this approach to web-app development(frontend part).

Currently many developers start new application with selecton of framework: React,
Vue, Angular. And only after that they consider real purpose of the application.

All projects are grouped by types as most common apps:

- admin panel
- shop
- company web portal
