# screaming-architecture
Inspired by book "Clean Architecture"

In his book Uncle Bob explains that each architecture of software should scream about
it's purpose. When you create any application it should be clear after first look 
what this software is created for. 

And another interesting idea that I found in the book is that first we should think
about entities - main rules of the application. Only after creating a list of basic entities we can move
forward and add next step of the project: Use-cases.
  
After these two steps you're ready to start thinking about everything else: frameworks, DB, gateways and so on.

In this repo I apply this approach to web-app development(frontend part).

Currently many developers start new application with selecton of framework: React,
Vue, Angular. And only after that they consider real purpose of the application.

All projects are grouped by types as most common apps:

- admin panel
- shop
- company web portal
